Dynamic Causal Reasoning Framework with Graph Re-orientation
Project Description
The idea proposed is to create a three-stage pipeline that uses causal graphs to ensure responses are causally sound and safe relative to the queries. 
Prelim Stage Design
1.	Knowledge Graph Generation:
a.	Extract entities, relationships and causal links from the knowledge base. 
b.	Create a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) where the nodes are the entities and the edges are the causal relationships. 
c.	Edge direction is what matters… (a->b means that a causes b, etc…)
2.	Graph Re-orientation based on the Query
a.	When a query comes in, the graph is rotated to make the query’s focal point the “target” variable. 
b.	We can use Conditional Independence (Prune irrelevant nodes based on d-separation) and Ancestral graph extraction (Keep only the nodes that are the ancestor/descendant of the query var).
c.	Example:
i.	What causes X? Make X the sink, trace backward to the parents
ii.	What are the effects of Y? Make Y the source, trace forward
iii.	Does A affect B? Find paths between A and B, check for confounders
3.	Causal Safety Validation
a.	Checking the response against the re-oriented graph
b.	Types of safety checks:
i.	Causal Direction Validity
ii.	Confounding Direction (If the response says a->b, if no direct relation check for a->c, c->b) 
Algorithm Choices
1.	Causal Discovery Algorithms
a.	Constraint Based
i.	PC Algorithm (Peter-Clark):
1.	Learns causal structure from observational data
2.	Uses conditional independence tests
3.	Library: causal-learn, pgmpy
ii.	FCI (Fast Causal Inference):
1.	Handles latent confounders
2.	Produces Partial Ancestral Graph (PAGs)
3.	More robust but comp. expensive
b.	Score-based
i.	GES (Greedy Equivalence Search):
1.	Searches through DAG space by scoring structure
2.	Uses BIC or other scoring functions
3.	Faster than constraint-based for large graphs
ii.	NOTEARS (Non-combinatorial Optimization):
1.	Formulates structure learning as continuous optimization
2.	Uses neural networks: notears-pytorch
3.	Scales better to high dimensions
c.	Hybrid:
i.	FGES (Fast GES)
